/**
 * find the sortest path using Best First Search
 * 
 * Description of question:-
 * In this question we are asked to start from a node and reach to another node
 * We need to use Best first search algorithim , in this algorithim we are given heuristic value to all the nodes and
 * we need to find the best possible path using heuristic value .
 * In the end  we need to display the the path and cost of the array
